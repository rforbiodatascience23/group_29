## Introduction to TCGA Pan-Cancer Dataset

-   Brief introduction to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)

-   Significance of the Pan-Cancer dataset in cancer genomics research

-   How this dataset helps in understanding cancer at a molecular level

## Project Aim and Focus

-   State the project's aim: "To perform an in-depth TCGA Pan-Cancer analysis, focusing on survival analysis."

-   Mention the use of Cox proportional hazards models to gain insights into cancer prognosis.

## Data Acquisition and Cleaning

-   Discuss sources of the TCGA dataset.

-   Outline the data cleaning process: handling missing values, standardizing formats, etc.

    -   drop values

    -   Impute values

## Data Transformation and Tools

-   Explain the data transformation and augmentation techniques used.

-   Highlight the use of Tidyverse in RStudio for data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis Insights

-   Summarize key findings from the EDA.

-   Include visualizations like bar charts or scatter plots to illustrate cancer-specific patterns.

## Survival Analysis Outcomes

-   Present the main results from the CoxPH model.

-   Use graphs (like survival curves) to visually represent the survival analysis.

## Interpreting the Model

-   GMB stands out - Risk of death nine times greater
:::

::: fragment
-   Age - Risk of death increases slightly with each additional year
:::

::: fragment
-   Gender - No significant difference based on gender
